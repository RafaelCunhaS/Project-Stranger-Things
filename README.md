## Project Stranger Things

Full-Stack project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

The goal of this project was to make a deploy on _Heroku_, utilizing __Docker__ on a production environment. Also a file to simulate an _Action_ on github (folder actions on the backend) was made to imitate a __CI/CD__ development.
